Abstract:	A 21-year record is presented of surface mass balance measurements along the K-transect. The series covers the period 1990-2011. Data are available at 8 sites along a transect over an altitude range of 390 - 1850 m at approximately 67Â° N in West Greenland. The surface mass balance gradient is on average 3.8 x 10**-3 m w.e./m, and the mean equilibrium line altitude is 1553 m a.s.l. Only the lower 3 sites within 10 km of the margin experience a significant increasing trend in the ablation over the entire period.
